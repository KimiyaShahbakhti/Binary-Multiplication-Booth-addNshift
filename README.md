# Booth's and Shift-and-Add Multiplication Algorithms in Java
This repository contains Java implementations of Booth's algorithm and Shift-and-add multiplication for binary number multiplication in computer architecture.

## Algorithms Overview
The provided Java code contains methods for performing signed and unsigned multiplication using Booth's algorithm and Shift-and-Add multiplication. It takes inputs as decimal numbers, converts them to binary, performs the multiplication operations, and returns the result.

### Booth's Algorithm
Booth's algorithm is a multiplication algorithm that efficiently multiplies two **signed binary numbers**.\
The algorithm uses an **array** to store the intermediate results and performs bitwise operations to determine the appropriate arithmetic operations. Specifically, it checks the bits of the multiplier to decide whether to add, subtract, or do nothing, based on the adjacent bits.

### Add-and-Shift Multiplication
Shift-and-add multiplication is a simple multiplication algorithm that involves shifting and adding operations.

## How to Use
To use the provided implementations of Booth's algorithm and Shift-and-add multiplication:

1. Clone the repository:\
`git clone https://github.com/KimiyaShahbakhti/Binary-Multiplication-Booth-addNshift.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory:\
`cd Booth-ShiftAndAdd-Multiplication`
3. Compile the Java files
